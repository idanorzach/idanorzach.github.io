    I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at MIT. I work on game theory with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/">Martin Rinard</a>.
    Before that I was an undergradute student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/">Nati Linial</a> on coding theory as part of the Amirim honors program.

<!-- <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>My name is Edan Orzech. 
<br>I am interesed in theoretical computer science, particularly in the intersection between mathematics and computer science. 
<br>More specifically, my interests are coding theory, optimization algorithmic game theory, and I find it fascinating when concepts in abstract algebra are involved.
<br>
<br>My CV can be found <a href="Edan Orzech - CV.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Papers</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Correlated vs. Uncorrelated Randomness in Adversarial Congestion Team Games. Idan Orzech, Martin Rinard, 2023. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08047">arXiv</a></li>

    <li>Decentralized Inference via Capability Type Structures in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems. Charles Jin, Zhang-Wei Hong, Farid Arthaud, Idan Orzech, Martin Rinard. 2023. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13957">arXiv</a></li>

<p>
    Note: sometimes my name is written as any combination of {Edan, Idan} and {Orzach, Orzech}. All of those are me (and as far as I know, I am the only person with any of those first & last name combinations...).
    The first is due to the difference in spelling of the English alphabet among Hebrew speakers vs. English speakers, and the last results from a Hebraization of Orzech ("nut" in Polish) to Orzach ("clean light" in Hebrew).

<!-- <h2>Research</h2>
<p>I am currently working with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/">Nati Linial</a> on a bachelor's honors thesis, and we have a paper in work. We are working on bounds on unique-neighbor codes, namely codes that satisfy the unique-neighbor property in the context of expander graphs. Those codes are important as they can and are used to implement efficient decoding algorithms, called <em>message-passing algorithms</em>.
<br>Manuscript: <a href="Unique_Neighbor_Codes.pdf">pdf</a>.
<br>
<br>I am also working with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~omri/">Omri Weinstein</a> on a thesis project in the area of numerical linear algebra and sketching.
<br>We are working on low-rank factorization algorithms, and attempt to devise an efficient SVD algorithm that uses an alternative idea to the "power method" idea.
