<h1>Biography</h1>

<p>My name is Edan Orzech. I am interesed in theoretical computer science, particularly in the intersection between mathematics and computer science.

    More specifically, my interests are coding theory, optimization algorithmic game theory, and I find it fascinating when concepts in abstract algebra are involved.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I am currently working with Professor Nati Linial on a bachelor's honors thesis, and we have a paper in work. We are working on bounds on unique-neighbor codes, namely codes that satisfy the unique-neighbor property in the context of expander graphs. Those codes are important as they can and are used to implement efficient decoding algorithms, called <em>message-passing algorithms</em>. Manuscript: tba</p>
