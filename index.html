<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>My name is Edan Orzech. 
<br>I am interesed in theoretical computer science, particularly in the intersection between mathematics and computer science. 
<br>More specifically, my interests are coding theory, optimization algorithmic game theory, and I find it fascinating when concepts in abstract algebra are involved.
<br>
<br>My CV can be found <a href="Edan Orzech - CV.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I am currently working with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/">Nati Linial</a> on a bachelor's honors thesis, and we have a paper in work. We are working on bounds on unique-neighbor codes, namely codes that satisfy the unique-neighbor property in the context of expander graphs. Those codes are important as they can and are used to implement efficient decoding algorithms, called <em>message-passing algorithms</em>.
<br>Manuscript: <a href="Edan Orzech - CV.pdf">pdf</a>.
<br>
<br>I am also working with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~omri/">Omri Weinstein</a> on a thesis project in the area of numerical linear algebra and sketching.
</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>My other interests include swimming (former competitive swimmer), trivia (1st place at a competition of Itai Hermann, "The Chase"), playing the piano, speedcubing and finding optimal strategies for various card games.</p>
